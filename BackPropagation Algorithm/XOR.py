# term (n_error). We arbitrarily initialize the input weights to random numbers
# between âˆ’1.0 and 1.0, and we set the bias weights to 0.0. The reason to randomly
# initialize the input weights is to break the symmetry. If all neurons start with the
# same initial weights, then the initial output of all neurons in a layer would also be
# identical. This in turn would lead to all neurons in the layer behaving the same
# during backpropagation, and they would all get the same weight adjustments.

# That is, we do not get any benefit from having multiple neurons in a layer. The
# bias weight does not need to be randomly initialized because it is sufficient to
# randomize the regular input weights to break the symmetry.

# Initializing bias weights to 0.0 is a common strategy.

# The forward_pass function first computes the outputs of neurons 0 and 1 with the same inputs

# We pick training examples in random order, call the functions forward_pass,
# backward_pass, and adjust_weights, and then print out the weights with
# the function show_learning. We adjust the weights regardless whether the
# network predicts correctly or not. Once we have looped through all four training
# examples, we check whether the network can predict them all correctly, and if
# not, we do another pass over them in random order.
# We want to point out a couple of issues before running the program. First, you
# might get a different result than our example produces given that the weights are
# initialized randomly. Similarly, there is no guarantee that the learning algorithm
# for a multilevel network will ever converge, and there are multiple reasons for
# this. It could be that the network itself simply cannot learn the function, Another reason
# convergence might fail is if the parameters and initial values for the learning
# algorithm are initialized in a way that somehow prevents the network from
# learning. That is, you might need to tweak the learning rate and initial weights to
# make the network learn the solution.
